 DFS & BFS Visualizer 🚀

An interactive **web-based visualizer** to understand and compare **Depth First Search (DFS)** and **Breadth First Search (BFS)** algorithms using a grid/maze representation.

📌 Project Overview

This project helps students visually understand how **DFS** and **BFS** explore nodes differently in a grid-based environment.  
Users can set **start points**, **end points**, draw **walls**, and watch how each algorithm traverses the grid step by step.

 🧠 Algorithms Used

🔹 Breadth First Search (BFS)
- Explores level by level
- Guarantees the shortest path
- Uses a **queue** data structure

 🔹 Depth First Search (DFS)
- Explores as deep as possible first
- Does not guarantee the shortest path
- Uses a **stack / recursion**
